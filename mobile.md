âœ¦ Okay, this is a fantastic way to think about the mobile application and how permissions will drive its
  functionality. You're essentially asking for a blueprint of the mobile app's user experience and the underlying
  security model.


  Here's a description of what the mobile app experience would be like for Supervisors and Technicians, the
  specific permissions required for each action, and how these permissions will dynamically control the UI.

  Mobile Application Experience: Roles & Permissions

  The mobile application will provide a tailored experience for Supervisors and Technicians, with UI elements and
  functionalities appearing or disappearing based on the user's assigned role and its associated permissions.

  1. Technician Mobile App Experience


  The Technician's app is focused on executing assigned tasks, tracking progress, and communicating.

       * Shows "My Assigned Maintenance Tasks."
       * Provides quick access to "Notifications."
       * UI Impact: Only these sections will be visible. No "Create Job," "Manage Users," or "Live Tracking"
         options.


   * Job Details View:
       * View job title, description, location, scheduled date, instructions.
       * Action: Update Job Status: Buttons like "Start Job," "Mark In Progress," "Complete Job," "On Hold."

       * Action: Site Check-in/Check-out: Buttons to "Check-in" upon arrival and "Check-out" upon departure.
       * UI Impact: Status update buttons are enabled/disabled based on current job status and jobs:update
         permission. Journey and check-in/out buttons are visible if tracking:start_journey, tracking:end_journey,

         notifications:mark_read and notifications:delete are granted.

  2. Supervisor Mobile App Experience


  The Supervisor's app provides oversight, management capabilities for their team, and access to broader
  operational data. They will have all Technician capabilities, plus additional management tools.


   * Dashboard/Home Screen:
       * Displays "My Assigned Jobs" and "My Assigned Maintenance Tasks" (like a Technician).

         technicians.

         and "Reports" sections are visible if users:read, tracking:read, and reports:read are granted,
         respectively.


   * Job Management (New Capabilities):
       * Action: Create Job: A form to create new jobs, including assigning them to technicians.
       * Action: Assign/Reassign Job: Ability to assign or reassign jobs to technicians.
